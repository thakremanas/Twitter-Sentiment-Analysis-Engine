# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Engine
This is a tweet sentiment analysis engine based on Python

Enter the username of your interest to see what kind of sentiments their tweet displays.

Disclaimer: This engine is not built using any ntlk libraries and hence the code is entirely made up of custom written functions and built from scratch.
I am using a json dictionary files which is static to map the tweets to the words in this dictionary.
